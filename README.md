# CS 5330 Programming Assignment 2: SIFT Feature Matching

# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command: `conda env create -f pa2_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa2'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa2` or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa2` or `source activate cs5330_pa2`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa2_code/pa2.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook file and the project report to Canvas.
